#@data/values

#! Here is just to highlight what you want to construct pipelines
#! For the detailed configuration of products, a `products.yml` should be checked in
#! to platform automation configuration repo, like `platform-automation-configuration/<ENV>/products.yml
#! Check this out for your reference: https://github.com/brightzheng100/platform-automation-configuration/tree/master/dev/products.xml

#! For the products, the format MUST follow a pattern:
#!
#! - <PRODUCT_ALIAS>|<PRODUCT_SLUG>[|<PRODUCT_NAME>]
#!
#! Where:
#! - <PRODUCT_ALIAS>: is the product alias which can be whatever you want to alias a product
#! - <PRODUCT_SLUG>: is the official slug which can be retrieved from command line `$ pivnet products`, as attched below
#! - <PRODUCT_NAME>: is required ONLY when <PRODUCT_NAME> is different compared to "<PRODUCT_SLUG>", see Notes 1
#!
#! Notes:
#! 1. For some historical reason, some products have different values about `PRODUCT_SLUG` and `PRODUCT_NAME`.
#!    For example, Pivotal Application Service (PAS)' PRODUCT_SLUG is "elastic-runtime" whereas "PRODUCT_NAME" is "cf",
#!    so we must define it like:
#!
#!    - pas|elastic-runtime|cf
#!
#! 2. See ../PIVNET-PRODUCTS.md for the detailed products
#!

products:

#! PAS
#! - pas|elastic-runtime|cf
#! - pas|elastic-runtime|srt

#! CSB
#! - csb|credhub-service-broker

#! Redis
#! - redis|p-redis

#! PKS
- pks|pivotal-container-service

#! Harbor
